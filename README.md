# neuroevolution-snake
"K" (yes it's in capital so that one wouldn't accidentally hit the keyboard and press it) means kill the remaining snakes and start the next generation.
"s" means save current longest snake's brain to a json file.
Press "l" to only show the longest snake or set it back to default view.
There are 1000 snakes generated that has it own "brain" to play this game.
The snakes' brains are each a neural network with 6 inputs, 6 hidden nodes and 3 outputs.
The goal of the snake (black) is to eat their own food (red) and grow longer.
The snake is killed when it either touches its own body or the walls of the space.
